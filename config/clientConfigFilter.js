// This is a filter that will be applied to our configuration in order to
// determine which of our configuration values will be provided to the client
// bundle.
//
// For security reasons you wouldn't want to make all of the configuration values
// accessible by client bundles as these values would essentially be getting
// transported over the wire to user's browsers.  There are however cases
// where you may want to expose one or two of the values within a client bundle.
//
// This filter object must match the shape of the configuration object, however
// you need not specify every property that is defined within the configuration
// object.  Simply define the properties you would like to be included in the
// client config, supplying a truthy value to them in order to ensure they
// get included in the client bundle.
